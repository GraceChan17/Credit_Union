On Sep.18 2024, the Federal Reserve announced a significant rate cut of 50 basis points, the first rate cut in over four years, lowering the target range to 4.75% to 5%. The Fed's substantial rate cut could potentially trigger deposit shocks, as it affects the interest rate structure across the entire financial system. This offers a prime opportunity to observe how banks and credit unions respond to such shocks. How do banks and credit unions differ in adjusting their deposit rates in response to major monetary policy changes, such as a significant Federal Reserve rate cut?

In response to this Federal Reserve rate changes, banks and credit unions are likely to exhibit different patterns in adjusting their deposit rates. Banks, primarily driven by profit maximization and short-term planning, are expected to adjust their rates more rapidly and closely in line with Fed rate changes. In contrast, credit unions, prioritizing member benefits and long-term relationships, are anticipated to demonstrate a more gradual and conservative adjustment process, potentially maintaining higher deposit rates for longer periods even as market rates decrease. This difference in adjustment patterns is expected to persist even when controlling for other economic factors and shocks that typically coincide with major rate changes.
